# Mini Challenge #2: CSS Snippet Cheat Sheet

The purpose of this weeks mini-challenge was to explore the different elements of advanced CSS and to create a reference for future use of specific CSS code. 

## In HTML: 
I first started by making the layout of the page in HTML. In the head, I externally linked first the reset.css and then the style.style css. Then in the body of the HTML I added its direct children: a header, main and footer. According to the mock up it looks like the header contains an h1 heading and a paragraph blurb explaining the purpose of the webpage. 

Then in the main tag, one section was created that will essentially contain all 6 cards. Within the section I created a div. This div and all of its nested elements will eventually be copied 6 times (With the content of the elements changing based on the different snippets) to make 6 different snippet cards. To add more cards in the future, one would need to copy the first div under the section and its children elements. This div has children elements of: 
 * A figure semantic element which will contain the heading of the card 
 * Another div with a paragraph element giving a blurb about that card's particular code
 * A pre element containing the specific code that is able to easily be highlighted upon clicking. 

Finally the footer will contain a "Thank you" message.

## In CSS: 
The style.css file contains the styling for the page and demonstrates the use of flexbox properties, pseudo elements, pseud classes, variables, media queries with transition elements. 

The CSS file contains comments for certain code within that file.
